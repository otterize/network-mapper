## About
The Otterize network mapper creates a map of in-cluster traffic by capturing DNS traffic and inspecting active connections then resolving the IP addresses participating in connections to the pods, and crawling up the ownership of the pod until it reaches the root object. See [Service name resolution](#service-name-resolution) to learn more. The network mapper continues building the network map as long as it's deployed.

You can then use the [Otterize CLI](https://github.com/otterize/otterize-cli) to list the traffic by client, reset the traffic the mapper remembers, or export it as JSON or YAML.

Example output from running the network mapper on the [Google Cloud microservices demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo):
```bash
$ otterize mapper list
cartservice in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - redis-cart
checkoutservice in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - kafka-secure
frontend in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - adservice
  - cartservice
  - checkoutservice
  - currencyservice
  - productcatalogservice
  - recommendationservice
  - shippingservice
kafka-secure in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - kafka-secure
  - lab-zookeeper
paymentservice in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - kafka-secure
recommendationservice in namespace ecommerce calls:
  - productcatalogservice
```

The YAML export of the network mapper outputs `ClientIntents` Kubernetes resource files. Client intents files can be consumed by the [Otterize intents operator](https://github.com/otterize/intents-operator) to configure pod-to-pod access with network policies, or Kafka client access with Kafka ACLs and mTLS. In this way, the network mapper can bootstrap [intent-based access control](https://otterize.com/ibac) for teams, and gradually roll out a zero-trust service-to-service architecture.

## How does the network mapper work?

### Components
- Sniffer - the sniffer is deployed to each node, and is responsible for capturing node-local DNS traffic and inspecting open connections.
- Mapper - the mapper is deployed once, and resolves service names using the Kubernetes API with traffic information reported by the sniffers.

### Service name resolution
Service name resolution is performed one of two ways:
1. If an `otterize/service-name` label is present, that name is used.
2. If not, a recursive look up is performed for the Kubernetes resource owner for a pod until the root is reached. For example, if you have a `Deployment` named `client`, which then creates and owns a `ReplicaSet`, which then creates and owns a `Pod`, then the service name for that pod is `client` - same as the name of the `Deployment`.

The goal is to generate a mapping that speaks in the same language that dev teams use, whether or not a label has been set.
